# SingtelAutomation

Source code for "TODO" MVC testing using Cucumber BDD and JUnit
Prerequisite: jdk 1.8 or Higher Version

Steps to run the test suite:

1) Download or clone the project from https://github.com/iswaryasr/SingtelAutomation.git to your local machine
2) Import the project using editors like Eclipse or Intellij from the downloaded path
3) Once Maven successfully builds all the required jars from the dependency file pom.xml, run the class TestRunner.java 
4) This will open the chrome browser automatically and execute the test cases
5) A separate folder "target" is created in the repository and the cucumber test reports are updated in cucumber.html which can be viewed using any browser.
6) Under src/test/resources, there is a file "config.properties" created to configure properties like URL.
